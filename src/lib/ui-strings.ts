// Manifest of English UI strings that get machine-translated when a user
// picks a non-English language (see src/components/i18n-provider.tsx). This
// is NOT a hand-written translation dictionary - every string here still
// only exists in English; /api/translate (backed by a free translation API)
// produces the actual Spanish/French/etc. text at runtime, cached so it's
// only ever translated once per string per language.
//
// Scope: navigation, page headings, primary buttons/CTAs, and the
// registration/login/forgot-password/demo-upgrade flows - the chrome a user
// sees most and the first-touch screens where language matters most.
// Market data (asset names, numbers, dates) and deep admin-only screens are
// intentionally left in English, same boundary as the currency conversion
// work (ledger/raw data stays canonical; display chrome gets localized).
